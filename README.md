This repository provides jupyter notebooks and simulation inputs that accompany the course [Hands-on tutorials: Enhanced sampling methods using GROMACS](https://weitsehsu.com/course/enhanced_sampling/) authored by [Wei-Tse Hsu](https://weitsehsu.com/). The course includes a series of tutorials on different enhanced sampling methods as outlined below:
- Chapter 1. Umbrella sampling
- Chapter 2. Metadynamics
- Chapter 3. Temperature replica exchange
- Chapter 4. Hamiltonian replica exchange
- Chapter 5. Expanded ensemble
- Chapter 6. Replica-exchange umbrella sampling
- Chapter 7. Alchemical metadynamics

All the tutorials can be run on Binder as linked in the badge above. For more information about the course and more comprehensive disucssion about each method, please visit the course website linked above.
