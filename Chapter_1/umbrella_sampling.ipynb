    "As a reminder, the purpose of a pulling simulation is to generate configurations with different values of CV (the ion-pair distance). The generated configurations will be used as the initial configurations in the subsequent production simulation. In a pulling simulations, we need to make the following two decisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Defining the pull groups**: The pull groups are groups of atom(s) we exert the pulling force between. Here, we define the sodium and chloride ions as the pull groups. In GROMACS, this setup can be done by adding **pull codes** to the `.mdp` file, as we will elaborate later.\n",
    "- **Choosing the immobile group**: To make the pulling process more efficient, it is recommended to applying a position restraint to one of the pull groups. In our case, we will choose to fix the position of the sodium ion, but fixing the chloride ion should not make a difference in the resulting free energy profile. As we will see in later, the application of the position restraint can be done by modifying the `.top` file.\n",
