    "## 2. Pulling simulation\n",
    "As a reminder, the purpose of a pulling simulation is to generate configurations with different values of CV (the ion-pair distance in this case). The generated configurations will be used as the initial configurations in the subsequent production simulations. In a pulling simulation, we need to make the following two decisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Defining the pull groups**: The pull groups are groups of atom(s) we exert the pulling force between. Here, we define the sodium and chloride ions as the pull groups. In GROMACS, this setup can be done by adding **pull codes** to the `.mdp` file, as we will detail later.\n",
    "- **Choosing the immobile group**: In umbrella sampling, it is common to apply a position restraint to one of the pull groups to make the pulling process more efficient. In our case, we will choose to fix the position of the sodium ion, but fixing the chloride ion should not make a difference in the resulting free energy profile. As we will see in later, the application of the position restraint can be done by modifying the `.top` file.\n",

    "Notably, varying levels of uncertainty can arise at different CV values, which stem from different numbers of uncorrelated samples. For example, in the region characterized by an ion-pair distance of around 0.25 nm, the uncertainty is minimal. In contrast, in regions corresponding to an ion-pair distance exceeding 0.6 nm, we observe a significant increase in uncertainty. This increased uncertainty is mainly attributable to the paucity of uncorrelated samples in these regions."
